📐 CSS Grid is a layout tool used to create grids in CSS, simplifying the process of designing layouts compared to floats and positioning.

📏 CSS Grid allows defining the number of columns and rows, and their sizes using properties like grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.

🗃️ Understanding grid lines, grid cells, grid tracks, and grid areas is essential for effective use of CSS Grid.

🛣️ Grid lines and cells can be named for easier reference, enhancing readability and maintenance of the code.

🆔 Grid areas can be named, allowing a more intuitive way to define and place items within the grid using grid-template-areas.

🏞️ Another method involves using grid-template-areas to directly name and allocate areas for items within the grid, simplifying layout organization.

🖼️ Using named grid areas like 'nav', 'side', 'article', and 'footer' makes it easy to allocate and position items within specific sections of the grid.

🎨 CSS Grid allows you to control the layout of items, specifying grid areas for them.

🌐 You can make items overlap by defining their grid areas, providing flexibility in layout.

📐 The FR unit in CSS Grid allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts.

🚧 The gap property helps create spacing between grid items, both row gap and column gap can be customized.

🔄 Justify and align items can be used to center items within their grid cells.

🔄 Individual items within the grid can be aligned or justified using align-self and justify-self properties.

🔁 The repeat function simplifies the creation of multiple columns or rows with the same size.

📏 The minmax property allows setting a minimum and maximum size for grid items, ensuring flexibility.

🧭 Justify content and align content help position the entire grid within its container.

🏞️ Place content and place items provide a shorthand for aligning and justifying content within the grid.
