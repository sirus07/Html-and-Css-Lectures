boxes have by default static property that lock their movement like if i want to add margin top left right so i can't do that
but if change static property to relative property i can do that only i want to remove the static property

position: relative;

if i want to show the box 1 first and second box behind the box 1 so use z index
all you have to remove the static property and use the relative and absolute property

Relative - Apni orginal position se change hogi
Absolute - apne parent ke relative position change hogi
Fixed - page mein position fixed hojaygi
Sticky - page mein kahin bhi ho, scroll krne pr neeche nhi jaygi, stick hojaygi
sticky genrally navbar ka liiye use krte hai
