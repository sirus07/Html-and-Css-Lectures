display: inline-block;
display: inline;
            /*If you give inline property and give some margin and pading so inline property don't obey this property
            if you wanna have margin and padding from all side, you have to give inline-block property*/
visibility: hidden;
|--> it will only hide your text not the whole element text space.


display: none;
|--> it will remove all the box and text and space used by the box.

 display: flex;
justify-content: center;
|--> If you want to center the text inside the box. So, you have to use these properties to center the text or anything

display:flex are used mostly of the time to center not only for center but mostly of the time we will use it.

 display: inline-flex; used it for making the element to come inline symetry and if we use only flex it will act as a block element
