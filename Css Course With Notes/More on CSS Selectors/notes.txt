📐 CSS selectors can be used to target specific elements, such as selecting the first child or the first line of a div.

🎨 Selecting elements inside a container using the dot notation, e.g., `.boxes *`, allows for styling multiple elements at once.
🤝 Grouping selectors, such as `p, a, .box`, allows applying styles to multiple selectors with a single rule.
🔢 The `nth-child` selector can be used to style elements based on their position, either odd or even, within a container.
✨ Utilizing `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements allows dynamically inserting content before or after an element.
📝 Styling specific parts of an element, such as the first letter, can be achieved using pseudo-elements like `::first-letter`.
🖋️ CSS can be used to style form elements, like changing the color and font size of a placeholder in an input field.
🎭 Attribute selectors, like `[data-color="primary"]`, enable styling based on specific attributes in HTML elements.
